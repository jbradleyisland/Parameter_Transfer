**Parameter Transfer** allows for the transfer of parameters across families and types without changing the underlying family or parameters outside of those expressly specified.

* Once the **Parameter Transfer** script is running you can select source and transfer elements along with the parameters to pull from and push to.

* Additionally you can select assemblies to propagate your selection to, for every transfer element in your selection the script will check the selected assemblies for all other instances of that element and apply the same parameter transfer to those elements.

* After selecting all of the source and transfer elements and parameters you can then run the add-in to apply the transfer.
